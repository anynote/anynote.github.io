What is `Object Oriented Programming`?

# 4 principles of OOP

## Encapsulation

Object keep its state private, inside class, other objects don't have direct access this state, they have to call public method instead

## Abstraction

It's natural expression of Encapsulation. Each object should only expose a high-level mechanism for using it. This mechanism should hide internal implementation details. It should only reveal operations relevant for the other objects.
## Inheritance
Reuse the common logic and extract the unique logic into a separate class
Each class adds only what is necessary for it while reusing common logic with the parent classes.
## Polymorphism
Polymorphism means “many shapes” in Greek

Polymorphism gives a way to use a class exactly like its parent so there’s no confusion with mixing types. But each child class keeps its own methods as they are.
